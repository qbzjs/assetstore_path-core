Funly Sky Studio

Video Tutorials: https://funly.io/taxonomy/term/4
Developer Manual: https://goo.gl/ZRfoNs

Setup:
Make sure you select your rendering pipeline. You'll see a file called "REQUIRED SETUP - PICK YOUR PIPELINE HERE"
inside the FunlySkyStudio folder, select that and follow the instructions in the inspector panel. After selecting
your pipeline, we will install all the demo scenes and support content.

We keep our documentation online, so that we can continually update it as we receive feedback
and questions from developers. Please send us an email if you have any issues, or you think
a section of the documentation could be better, and we'd be happy to update it.

Happy Sky Building!
